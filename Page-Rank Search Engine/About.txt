This project features a directed graph (adjacency matrix) to represent a search engine roughly modeled by the Page-rank algorithm.
It is made up of custom classes to create objects for each page and URL. Pages are abstractly linked to each other to provide a page-rank.

The final product is wrapped in a clean Java Swing GUI that features the following operations:

- Add a page
- Add a link
- Remove a page
- Remove a link
- Search key words to receive search results

Also features a custom comparator to sort search results alphabetically by Page, URL, or numerically by Page rank.
User is also given option to edit a txt file to quickly add/remove/modify Pages and Links in the directed graph.
