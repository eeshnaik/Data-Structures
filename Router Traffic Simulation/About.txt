This project creates a simulation software to better understand the complex dynamics behind packet transfer in routers.
It features 3 sets of routers (1 packet sourcing router, 1 destination router, and a variable amount of intermediate routers).

Each packet is given a size and an approximate time to destination.
Each router is attributed with a bandwidth (n packets at a certain moment).
Packets are dropped if the bandwidth is exceeded.

A simulation is then run to determine the following key statistics:
- Network rutime
- Average Time for packet to reach destination
- # of packets dropped

Paramters for the simulation (# of routers, router bandwidth, etc) can be changed by the user to see how the key statistics change.
The status of each router and packet is detailed at each simulation unit.
