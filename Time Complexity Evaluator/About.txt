This project analyzes Python code and produces a detailed breakdown of its time complexity.
The program parses through a .py file and recognizes key words & symbols and uses it to generate a report.

The parsing algorithm centers around the use of the Stack data structure.

The report details the time complexity of every block of code. 
Its currently limited to only a medium sized range of keywords and code patterns
